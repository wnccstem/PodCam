# PodsInSpace / PodCam Python dependencies
# NOTE: On Raspberry Pi OS / Debian, some camera-related packages are better installed via apt
# (system packages) rather than pip to ensure native bindings work with libcamera.
# Recommended apt installs (DO NOT duplicate in pip if already installed):
#   sudo apt install -y python3-picamera2 python3-libcamera python3-opencv python3-numpy python3-smbus
#   sudo apt install -y rpicam-apps (or libcamera-apps on older images)
# If you use a virtualenv, create it with --system-site-packages so these apt packages are visible.

# If using headless environment, replace with opencv-python-headless
opencv-python  

# Core scientific / imaging
numpy

# Camera (optional via pip; prefer apt)
# picamera2  # Usually installed via apt (python3-picamera2); uncomment ONLY if you need a pip build
# libcamera  # Provided by OS packages; not typically available/needed via pip

# Sensors
bme680       # Gas/temperature/humidity sensor library
smbus2       # I2C communication for moisture sensor

# Networking / HTTP
requests

# Scheduling / task control
schedule

# CLI utilities / output formatting
rich         # Colored console output and panels

# Speed test (bandwidth measurements)
speedtest-cli  # Provides the 'speedtest' Python module

# Streaming / video (already covered by opencv)
# If you add JPEG/FFmpeg enhancements explicitly you might also need:
Pillow    

# Email sending uses Python stdlib (smtplib, email) so no extra package required.

# If deployment requires explicit version pinning, add ==<version> after each package.
